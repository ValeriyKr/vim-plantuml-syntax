This repository contains a couple of files, which describes to vim, how
to highlight PlantUML source files.

The syntax file was written during my work with PlantUML. There was no aim
to cover all PlantUML keywords, syntax constructions, operators, etc. The
only goal was to make *my* work with PlantUML mere convenient.

Thus, if *you* have something to improve -- contributions are welcome. But i
will not add anything new by myself until *i* use the feature.

And, sure, it's free for everything you want to do. Anybody can use it,
distribute and modify without any restrictions.
